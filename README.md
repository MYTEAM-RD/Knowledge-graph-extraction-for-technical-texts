A new method for extracting knowledge graphs and NER in specialized French texts
This file contains two notebook files, one for the knowledge graph and the other for unsupervised Named Entity Recognition.
You only need to run the .ipynb to get the knowledge graph, but in this file, variables such as the 'final_list_50' and the 'logisticRegr_2' are used, and how to get them is shown in the NER-unsupervised.ipynb.
Since the data used in this work is private and we are not allowed to publish them, we used only a small sentence as the input in NER-unsupervised.ipynb , so you can not get a result similar to ours ('final_list_50' and 'logisticRegr_2'), we just put the code and the result in this file so that you can expand your model by taking ideas from it.
