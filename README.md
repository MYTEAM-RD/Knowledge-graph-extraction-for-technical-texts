# Knowledge-graph extraction for technical French texts

A new method for extracting knowledge graphs for highly specialized and technical French texts.

This file contains two notebook files, one for extracting the knowledge graph and the other for setting up the unsupervised Named Entity Recognition method.

You only need to run the .ipynb to extract a knowledge graph, but in this file, variables such as the 'final_list_50' and the 'logisticRegr_2' are used. The notebook NER-unsupervised.ipynb present the method to get them. Since the data used in this work is private and we are not allowed to publish them, we used only a small sentence as the input in NER-unsupervised.ipynb , so you can not get a result similar to ours ('final_list_50' and 'logisticRegr_2'), we just put the code and the result in this file so that you can expand your model by taking ideas from it.

All these files are available via this link on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F0dMaTUs8JFixuzvnvZKiu5yuhaPBydq?usp=sharing
